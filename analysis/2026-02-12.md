NS=6 overbid to 4♥ (DD: only 9 tricks in hearts) and went down 1. As EW we just
defended — nothing notable. Neutral board.

**Result: 3.0 MP — Good**

NS=6 competed to 2♠ vulnerable and went down 1 (-100). Good judgment to let them play
and go down rather than competing in our own suit.

**Result: 0.0 MP — BOTTOM**

Freak hand — South has 10(!) clubs, North has 7 hearts with a club void. NS=6 bid 5♣-1
and we only collected +50. Other EW pairs collected +100 and +300.

**Bidding failure.** Our East held ♠Q10864 ♥J ♦AKQ753 ♣4 — a massive two-suited hand
that should have competed aggressively with diamonds/spades. At one table EW doubled 4♥
for +300. We let NS land softly in 5♣ undoubled. East needed to show distributional
strength (5♦ or higher) to create a forcing situation or find a double.

**Result: 0.0 MP — BOTTOM**

NS=6 played 1NT+4 (+210) — best NS score. Other tables: 2♥+2 (+170) and 2♥= (+110).
1NT scores more per overtrick than hearts (30 vs 30, but 1NT base 40 + 50 partial bonus =
90 vs hearts base 60 + 50 = 110 at 2-level... the key is NS made the same 10 tricks but
the 1NT contract yielded a higher total).

**Lead issue.** Our West led ♦9 from ♦AQ86. This is a non-standard lead — 4th best (♦6)
is correct from AQ86. The ♦9 may have given declarer a cheap trick or tempo. Other
Wests led ♦4 (standard). Partly unlucky that NS chose 1NT over 2♥, but the lead didn't
help.

**Result: 2.0 MP — Average**

NS=6 played 3♦= for +110. DD says NS can make 10 diamonds or 3NT. NS stopped low and
so did we as defenders. Nothing remarkable — average board.

**Result: 3.0 MP — Good**

EW=5 bid to 6♠ which is wrong (DD: only 10 tricks in spades, but 12 in NT/clubs). Going
down 2 vulnerable = +200 for us. EW's bidding error — wrong strain for slam. We just
defended normally (all same ♣9 lead). Benefited from opponent's ambitious but misdirected
slam attempt.

| **1** |   5 | W 3NT +2 | ♠3   |   -460   | 0.0 / 4.0 |

**Result: 0.0 MP — BOTTOM**

**Critical lead error.** Our South led ♠3 from a singleton ♠J into declarer's ♠AKQ10.
This handed West three free spade tricks and tempo to run the hand: 3NT+2 = -460.

At the other 3NT table, North led ♠8 from ♠87543 — declarer only made +1 (-430). At
the third table, EW overbid to 6♥ and went down 2 on a ♦6 lead.

**The correct lead: ♦A from South's ♦AQ963.** This attacks our best suit, sets up
diamond tricks, and doesn't help declarer. A singleton lead into known strength (AKQ10)
is a classic error. This one lead cost 4.0 MP.

**Result: 4.0 MP — TOP!**

**Excellent bidding AND play.** We bid to 3NT and made 12 tricks (+490). DD says 11
tricks — we found an extra trick! One NS only played 1NT+4 (+210 — missed game with 20
HCP in North). The other made 3NT+1 (+430).

The ♦9 lead from East may have helped establish our diamond suit, but making 12 tricks
still requires precise technique — finessing diamonds, establishing clubs, reading the
position. Outstanding board.

| **1** |   5 | E 3NT =  | ♥10  |   -600   | 4.0 / 0.0 |

**Result: 4.0 MP — TOP!**

**Brilliant defensive lead.** All three tables played 3NT by EW. Both other tables let
declarer make 10 tricks (-630). Our South led **♥10** — this found North's ♥QJ96 and
established a heart trick, holding declarer to exactly 9 tricks (-600).

Other leads (♣5, ♦6) gave declarer time to develop tricks. The ♥10 hit partner's
holding perfectly. This is the kind of lead that separates good defenders from average
ones. Saved 30 points, gained 3.0 MP over the field.

**Result: 4.0 MP — TOP!**

**Winning lead.** All three tables played S 2♠. Only at our table did it go down. The
difference: **we led ♦10** while both other tables led a heart.

Why ♦10 works: it immediately attacks with West's 7-card diamond suit, setting up
defensive tricks before declarer can establish spades. Heart leads gave declarer tempo to
draw trumps and ruff. The ♦10 lead from ♦1098762 is aggressive but correct — lead your
long suit. Superb defensive judgment.

North has 23 HCP — DD says 6♠ makes! All three tables missed the slam (4♠, 4♠, 4NT).
Our table played N 4NT= for +630, a middle result. As EW, we just defended normally.
Nothing special to do here.

**Slight underbid.** Our East played only 2♣= (+90). Par is 2NT= (+120). East has
♠A108 ♥1086 ♦AQ4 ♣KQ96 (15 HCP). Combined with West's 8 HCP = 23 combined —
enough for 2NT. The other EW who bid 2NT and made it scored 120. Conservative but safe.

NS=2 only bid 3♥+1 instead of reaching 4♥= (+420). As EW, we benefited from their
conservative bidding. Tied with the other +170 table. Good result partly from opponent's
underbid.

South has 25 HCP — 3NT is automatic. Two tables made 3NT= (+600). Third table NS
overbid to 6♠-2 (-200), gifting that EW a windfall top. We defended 3NT correctly.
Nothing we could have done — pure luck that another NS pair self-destructed. No error
on our part.

**Result: 4.0 MP — TOP!**

**Smart conservative bidding.** DD says N 4♠= makes, but in practice it's treacherous —
North needs to finesse ♠AQ against East's ♠KJ94, East holds the singleton ♦A as a
defensive tempo card, and South's ♠108752 provides only length, not quality.

At other tables: S 4♠-1 (-50) — game failed from the wrong side. N 2♥-2 (-100) — even
2♥ went down when East led ♦A. Our 2♥= was pragmatic — we recognized the danger and
stopped at a plus score. The field validated this: nobody made game.

Our North holds ♠10654 ♥AK8 **♦KQ4** ♣943. The ♦K or ♦Q lead is textbook — it's a
top-of-sequence lead from your strongest holding. The ♣4 walked straight into declarer's
♣AQJ52, giving a free finesse and an easy overtrick.

**Rule: always lead from sequences (KQ) over from nothing (943).** Cost 3.0 MP.

♦K7 ♣AJ1063 (14 HCP, 3-card support). Combined **26 HCP** with a 5-3 heart fit —
that's a textbook game try that should reach 4♥.

One table even made 11 tricks (2♥+3). Bidding 4♥= would have scored +620 vulnerable,
a clear top. This was a pure bidding miss.

NS=4 bid to 6♠ (the par contract!) but went down 1. DD says it makes — so why did it
fail? **Our West's ♦A lead was the killing blow.** It cashed the setting trick immediately
before declarer could discard losers. Against a slam, leading your ace when you suspect
declarer has a long side suit is a critical decision.

The third table only bid 4♠+2, scoring +480 (top for them). Both slam tables went down.
Excellent defensive lead.

**Result: 2.0 MP — Average**

Our W 4♣-1 gave NS +100. This was a competitive push — going to 4♣ over NS's hearts.
Decent sacrifice concept (if NS makes 4♥ = +620, giving up only 100 is great). But one
EW played 3♣ making (-110 NS) for a better result. The average 2.0 reflects the middle
ground. Acceptable competitive decision.

**Result: 4.0 MP — TOP!**

**Superior declarer play.** All three tables played W 2♠, all facing the same ♥A lead.
But only we made 10 tricks (2♠+2 = +170). Other tables: 9 tricks (+140) and 7 tricks
(-50).

With West's ♠AJ9852 and East's ♠K4 plus ♦AJ7 and ♣A82, making 10 tricks requires
excellent technique — finessing spades correctly, using the ♦AJ to set up a trick, and
managing entries. Three extra tricks compared to the worst table on the same contract.
**Pure card play excellence.**

**Result: 1.0 MP — Below Average**

**Bidding failure.** We let NS play 2♦ going down 2 (+100) instead of competing in
spades. Our combined spade holding: West ♠KJ9 + East ♠A643 = 7 spades with all honors.
DD says we make 2♠+1 (+140).

The table that bid E 3♠= scored +140, beating our +100. East has ♠A643 and ♣A109765 —
a 2♣ overcall or spade bid was available. Missing this competition cost the top.

## Key Findings

### Bidding Patterns

| Issue                        | Boards     | Impact                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Underbidding own hands**   | 13, 21, 25 | Missed game (21), missed competition (25) |
| **Insufficient competition** | 3, 25      | Let opponents off cheap                   |
| **Smart conservative stops** | 17, 19     | Saved from disasters the field fell into  |

We tend to bid conservatively. This saved us on boards 17 and 19 (where the field
overbid), but cost us on board 21 (clear game missed with 26 combined HCP and a 5-3
heart fit) and board 25 (should have competed in a 7-card spade fit).

### Opening Lead Analysis

| Lead                   | Board | Suit Led     | Quality       | MP Effect |
| ---------------------- | ----: | ------------ | :------------ | --------: |
| ♠3 from ♠J (singleton) |     8 | Into AKQ10   | **Terrible**  |      -4.0 |
| ♣4 from ♣943           |    20 | Into AQJ52   | **Bad**       |      -3.0 |
| ♦9 from ♦AQ86          |     4 | Non-standard | Questionable  |     -2.0? |
| ♥10 from ♥104          |    10 | Hit QJ96     | **Brilliant** |      +3.0 |
| ♦10 from ♦1098762      |    11 | Long suit    | **Brilliant** |      +4.0 |
| ♦A vs 6♠ slam          |    22 | Cash out     | **Perfect**   |      +1.0 |

**Clear pattern:** When we lead from sequences or long suits, we excel. When we make
"creative" leads from short holdings into likely strength, it backfires.

**Rule to reinforce:** Prefer sequences and length. Avoid singleton/doubleton leads in
side suits against notrump. Never lead from a short holding into known or likely strength.

### Declarer Play Assessment

| Board | Contract | DD Tricks | Our Tricks | Assessment  |
| ----: | -------- | --------: | ---------: | :---------- |
|     9 | N 3NT+3  |        11 |         12 | Outstanding |
|    24 | W 2♠+2   |         8 |         10 | Outstanding |
|    19 | S 3♠=    |         8 |          9 | Good        |
|    18 | S 2♣=    |         8 |          8 | Adequate    |

Declarer play is a genuine strength — consistently matching or exceeding double-dummy.

### Defense (Excluding Leads)

| Board | Contract | Our Result | Field Result | Assessment  |
| ----: | -------- | :--------- | :----------- | :---------- |
|    10 | E 3NT    | 9 tricks   | 10 tricks    | Excellent   |
|    11 | S 2♠     | 7 tricks   | 9 tricks     | Excellent   |
|    22 | S 6♠     | 11 tricks  | 12 (DD)      | Excellent   |
|     8 | W 3NT    | 11 tricks  | 10 tricks    | Poor (lead) |

---

## Overall Assessment

### Strengths

- **Declarer play** is excellent — consistently at or above double-dummy
- **Best leads** are truly outstanding (boards 10, 11, 22)
- **Conservative bidding** keeps us out of disasters on tricky hands

### Weaknesses to Work On

1. **Opening leads:** The 2 bottom-causing leads (boards 8, 20) share the same error
   pattern — leading from weak holdings into likely strength. Drill: always consider
   what's in dummy and prefer top-of-sequence leads
2. **Competitive bidding:** Too passive when opponents buy the contract (boards 3, 25) —
   need to balance and compete more with distributional hands
3. **Game bidding with 25+ combined HCP:** Board 21 was a clear miss — with a known fit
   and 26 combined HCP, game should be automatic

### Impact Estimate

| Fix                       | Current |    Gain | Projected |
| ------------------------- | ------: | ------: | --------: |
| Fix 2 lead errors (8,20)  |   56.0% | +7.0 MP |      ~63% |
| Better competition (3,25) |       — | +3.0 MP |      ~66% |
| Bid games (21)            |       — | +2.0 MP |      ~68% |

**With these fixes, 56% becomes ~65%+ — a strong regional-level result.**
