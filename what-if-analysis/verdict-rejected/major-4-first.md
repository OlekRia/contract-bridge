# What If: Open Major First with 4-4 Major-Minor?

> **Proposal:** When holding 4 cards in a major and 4 cards in a
> minor, open the major instead of the lower suit.
>
> **Verdict: Rejected.** Undermines the system's core principle for a
> benefit we already get for free.

## Context

Current rule: with two 4-card suits, open the lower one first. This
means 4-major + 4-minor always opens the minor. The change would
affect **15-17 balanced hands** (12-14 opens 1NT, so it doesn't
apply).

## Example: ♠KQxx ♡Axx ♢KJxx ♧xx (16 HCP)

### Current: open 1♢

- Partner bids 1♠ (5 if weak) → raise with 4-card support. Fit found!
- Partner bids 1♡ → rebid 1♤ naturally, showing 4 spades cheaply at the 1-level.
- Partner bids 1NT → pass. Partscore, fine.
- Partner bids 2♢ → rebid 2NT (15-17, confirms 4♢).

Auction stays low. Major fit found when partner has the major.

### Proposed: open 1♠

- Partner bids 1NT → pass. Partner might have 4♢ and you'll never know.
- Partner bids 2♢ → rebid 2NT? But partner thought you had 5♠.
- Partner bids 2♠ (3-card support) → stuck in a 4-3 fit instead of a possible 4-4 diamond fit.

Auction compressed. Partner must respond at the 2-level with any minor.

## Analysis

|                                      | Open lower (current)         | Open major (proposed)              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Frequency of 4-card major openings   | Rare (only 4♠-4♡ type)      | Every 4-major + 4-minor hand       |
| Partner's trust in "5 by default"    | High                         | Eroded                             |
| Auction space after opening          | 1-level responses available  | Often forced to 2-level            |
| Finding the major fit                | Partner bids it over the minor | Already shown, but at a cost     |

## Why it's negative

1. **Dilutes "5 by default."** The minor openings are the system's
   shock absorber — designed to absorb 4-card holdings. Opening
   "major first" shifts that burden to the majors, making 4-card
   major openings much more common.

2. **Compresses the auction.** After 1♢, partner can respond 1♡ or
   1♠ cheaply. After 1♠, partner with hearts or a minor must bid at
   the 2-level.

3. **Solves a problem that doesn't exist.** The current rule already
   finds major fits — partner bids the major over the minor, and
   opener raises. You don't need to open 1♠ to find spades.

4. **Worsens Known Problem #3.** 1♤ showing only 4 cards becomes frequent rather than rare.
