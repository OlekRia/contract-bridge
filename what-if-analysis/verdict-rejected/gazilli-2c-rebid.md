## The Problem Gazilli Solves

After 1♡ - 1NT, opener might have:

- **Hand A:** ♠xx ♡AQxxx ♢Kxx ♧xxx (12 HCP) — wants to pass
- **Hand B:** ♠AK ♡AKJxx ♢KQxx ♧xx (19 HCP) — wants to force to game

Currently both hands are stuck. Hand A passes 1NT (fine). Hand B has
to jump to 3♢ (which may be too high) or bid 2♢ (which partner can
pass with a minimum).

## How Gazilli Works

After 1♡ - 1NT (must be forcing for Gazilli to work):

| Opener's Rebid | Meaning                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2♧             | **Gazilli:** clubs OR 16+ any shape  |
| 2♢             | Natural, 4+ diamonds, 12-15 HCP     |
| 2♡             | 6+ hearts, 12-15 HCP                |
| 2♤             | Natural, 4+ spades (reverse), 16+   |

After 1♡ - 1NT - 2♧:

| Responder's Rebid | Meaning                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 2♢                 | Relay, 6-9 HCP (weak)           |
| 2♡                 | Weak, preference for hearts      |
| 2NT+               | 10+ HCP, game interest           |

After the 2♢ relay, opener clarifies: 2♡ = minimum with clubs, 2NT+ = strong hand.

## Why It's Tempting

1. **Clean separation of strength.** After Gazilli, ALL non-2♧ rebids
   are limited (12-15). Responder knows immediately whether to pass
   or push.

2. **Opener with 16+ always gets to describe.** No more guessing
   whether to jump or underbid.

3. **Works beautifully with 5-card majors.** The guaranteed 5+ cards
   in the major means opener's shape is well-defined for the rebid
   structure.

## Why It's Problematic for All Fives

### 1. Requires Forcing 1NT

Gazilli only works if 1NT is forcing. If responder can pass 1NT (as
currently in All Fives), opener never gets to bid 2♧. You'd need to
adopt Forcing 1NT first — which is itself a significant system
change.

### 2. 2♧ loses its natural meaning

After 1♡ - 1NT - 2♧, responder doesn't know if opener has clubs or a
strong hand. This ambiguity persists until the third round of
bidding. In competitive auctions (where opponents bid over 2♧), the
ambiguity may never resolve.

### 3. Complexity vs. frequency

The problem scenario (opener with 16+ after a 1NT response) is not
common. Most of the time opener has 12-15 and rebids naturally.
Gazilli adds a convention that fires rarely but must be remembered
always.

### 4. Contradicts "bids mean what they look like"

2♧ does NOT mean clubs. It means "clubs or strong." This is exactly
the kind of artificial dual-meaning bid that the system's philosophy
warns against.

## Verdict

Gazilli solves a real problem (wide-range rebids after 1NT response)
but requires Forcing 1NT as a prerequisite and adds artificial
complexity. For All Fives, the simpler solution is: if you adopt
Forcing 1NT, opener with 16+ can just bid naturally at the 2-level
(forcing because of the 1NT convention) without needing an artificial
2♧.

**If Forcing 1NT is adopted:** Gazilli becomes unnecessary — the
forcing nature of 1NT already keeps the auction alive for strong
hands.

**If Forcing 1NT is NOT adopted:** Gazilli doesn't work at all.

Either way, Gazilli isn't the right fit.
