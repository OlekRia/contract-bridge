# What If: Precision-Style Strong 1♧ (16+ HCP)?

> **Proposal:** Make 1♧ artificial, showing 16+ HCP (any shape). All

## How It Would Work

| Opening | Meaning                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1♧      | Artificial, 16+ HCP (any shape)  |
| 1♢      | Natural, 5+ diamonds, 11-15 HCP  |
| 1♡      | Natural, 5+ hearts, 11-15 HCP    |
| 1♤      | Natural, 5+ spades, 11-15 HCP    |
| 1NT     | 13-15 balanced                    |
| 2♧      | Natural clubs (since 1♧ is taken) |

## The Appeal

### 1. Eliminates "4 cards with extra strength"

The entire "escape to NT" mechanism exists because strong balanced
hands (15-17) can't open 1NT and must open a suit with only 4 cards.
With strong 1♧, ALL hands 16+ go through 1♧ — suit openings are
always natural, limited, and promise 5+. No exceptions, no escapes.

### 2. Responder always knows opener's range

After any non-1♧ opening, responder knows opener has 11-15. Game is
only possible if responder has 15+ HCP (combined 26+). This
simplifies every auction — responder either passes, invites, or
insists on game. No guessing about opener's range.

### 3. Competitive bidding is clearer

Limited openings make competition easier. Partner overcalls or
doubles — you know their range precisely. The opponents also know,
but the clarity helps your side more than it hurts.

## Why It Destroys All Fives

### 1. 1♧ no longer means clubs

The system says "bids mean what they look like." A 1♧ opening that
means "16+ anything" looks like clubs but isn't. This is the most
fundamental violation of the system's philosophy possible.

### 2. The natural club opening disappears

Where do you open with 5+ clubs and 11-15? If 1♧ is strong, you need
a different mechanism — typically 2♧ (but that's your Benji
semi-strong bid). The entire 2-level structure would need rebuilding.

### 3. The 1NT range must change

With strong 1♧ at 16+, you can't open 1NT with 12-14 and also have
15 go through 1♧. The typical Precision structure uses 1NT = 13-15 or
14-16. This changes the entire NT structure — responses, ranges,
everything.

### 4. Two artificial bids at the 1-level

Currently the system has zero artificial openings — everything means
what it looks like. Adding strong 1♧ means 1♧ is artificial. Combined
with the necessarily artificial 2♧ (strong clubs are gone, so Benji
needs restructuring), you'd have multiple artificial bids. The system
becomes a Precision variant, not Acol.

### 5. You lose the Benji structure entirely

Currently: 2♧ = semi-strong (Benji), 2♢ = game-force. With strong 1♧
absorbing 16+ hands, what does 2♧ do? What does 2♢ do? The entire
2-level framework must be rebuilt from scratch.

### 6. Tournament restrictions

Strong club systems face specific regulations in many jurisdictions
(EBU, ACBL). You may need to provide more detailed system notes, face
restrictions at certain competition levels, or submit your system for
pre-approval.

## The Honest Assessment

Precision-style strong 1♧ is a perfectly valid system approach. Many
world champions play it. But it's a **different system** — it solves
different problems, makes different trade-offs, and requires different
infrastructure.

All Fives is built on natural bidding with minimal artificial
machinery. Strong 1♧ is built on artificial machinery with natural
follow-ups. These are opposite design philosophies. You can't graft
one onto the other — you'd have to choose.

## Verdict

If you want to play Precision, play Precision. If you want to play
All Fives, the "4 cards with extra strength" escape is the price of
natural bidding — and it's a small price. The system already minimizes
it (5 by default, escape to NT is rare and well-defined).
