# What If: Canape Style Bidding?

> **Proposal:** Use canape (bid shorter suit first, longer suit

> **Verdict: Rejected.** Contradicts the system's core philosophy at every level.

## What is canape?

Bid your **shorter** suit first, longer suit second. With 5♡-4♢,
open 1♢ and rebid 2♡. The second bid shows the real suit.

## Opener Canape

Directly destroys the system's foundation. The entire point of All
Fives is "we always open with 5+ in the suit." Canape means you
*regularly* open with 4 (or even 3) cards, then show your long suit
on the rebid.

The problem is competitive:

**Hand:** ♠xx ♡KQxxx ♢AKxx ♧xx

- **Current (natural):** Open 1♡. Opponents overcall 2♧. Partner can
  raise hearts, compete, make decisions — because 1♡ means hearts.
- **Canape:** Open 1♢. Opponents overcall 2♧. You never get to show
  hearts. Partner defends thinking you have diamonds. Disaster.

Canape works in systems built around it (Blue Club, some Precision
variants) because the entire structure — responses, competitive
methods, everything — is designed for it. Bolting it onto a natural
system breaks the natural part without gaining the canape advantages.

## Responder Canape

Even worse. The system specifically says "1-major response to 1-minor
shows 5 if weak." Responder canape reverses this: responder bids a
4-card major first, then shows a longer minor. Now opener can't raise
the major (might be only 4), and the "opener may support with just 3
cards" logic collapses.

## Both Canape

That's not modifying All Fives. That's writing a different system entirely.

## The Irony: All Fives Already Has the Right Amount

When opener has a 4-card suit with 15-17 balanced, he opens the
4-card suit and rebids NT. That *is* a controlled, limited canape —
shorter suit first, then NT to clarify. It works because:

- It's limited to balanced hands only
- The NT rebid immediately tells partner "I had only 4"
- It never happens in unresolved competitive auctions

Full canape removes all those safety rails.

## Why It Contradicts the Philosophy

The system says "bids mean what they look like." Canape bids do NOT
look like what they mean — your opening suit is your short suit, not
your long one. This is a fundamental incompatibility, not a tuning
issue.
