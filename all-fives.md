## Philosophy

We play solid and we play what we see. No wild bids, no destructive actions. No gamble, no suicide, no guessing.
Whatever a partner bid we should understand as it makes sense and respect his choice.

- **No crazy openings.** We would never open 2♡ with just 4 HCP - that could ruin partner's decision-making. If partner knows you are reliable, he can trust that knowledge.
- **Bids mean what they look like.** A sequence like 1♧ - 3♧ is not destructive - it is an **invitation to 3NT**.
- **Use the opponents' information.** If they have shown 18+ points both hands, temper your ambitions for game.
- **Stay flexible.** This is an experimental system and may be adjusted as we learn.

Most of the time we will face competitive auctions, but keeping our opening principles in mind is essential.

## Known Problems

| #   | Problem                                                                                             |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Opening in 3rd/4th seat where 12 HCP 1NT doesn't make sense - better to play 15-17 HCP there.       |
| 2   | The 4441 distribution. Every system struggles with this.                                            |
| 3   | 1♤ usually promises 5 spades, but with a strong 4333 hand it may show only 4 - which feels awkward. |

---

## The Central Idea

> Maybe it is strange, but **We always open with 5+ cards in the suit.**

**1♧ / 1♢ / 1♡ / 1♤** shows 5 cards with an unbalanced hand (long suit or two-suited).
This is what you should assume whenever you see a 1-level suit opening.

**But with extra strength** (more than a bare minimum), opener may hold only 4 cards.
In that case, opener "escapes" to NT on the next bid, or makes a reverse (strong by definition).

> So while the opening _may_ show 4 cards, always think **5 by default**.

### **Example:** Opener's Rebids After 1♧ - 1♡

| Rebid        | Meaning                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 1NT          | 15-17 HCP (balanced escape)        |
| 2NT          | 18-19 HCP (balanced escape)        |
| 2♧           | 6+ clubs, or 5 with extra strength |
| 2♢ / 2♡ / 2♤ | Reverse - 16+ HCP                  |

**Bottom line:** if opener doesn't hold 5 cards, he holds exactly 4.

---

## Openings

### 1NT -

- 12-14 HCP
- third hand is 15-17 HCP

**Shape:** 4333 / 4432 / 5332 (including a 5-card major, yes)

Third hand 15-17, because it is only the risk we have with a weak hand, we block ourself without a chance to have a Game.

#### Responses

| Bid | Meaning                                                                                 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2♧  | **Puppet Stayman** - asks for a 5-card major. 2♢ denies; then we check for 4-card fits. |
| 2♢  | Transfer to ♡                                                                           |
| 2♡  | Transfer to ♤                                                                           |
| 2♤  | Transfer to ♧                                                                           |
| 3♧  | Transfer to ♢                                                                           |

#### SOS Redouble

         ```
         1NT - (X) - Pass - Pass
         XX   = SOS - please bid a suit!
         ```

The opponents have shown they hold the balance of power. We try to escape cheaply into a suit (likely a 4-3 fit). Partner retains the option to pass and play 1NTxx. This is extremely rare.

> **1NT is both the strength and the weakness of this system.** We may occasionally suffer, but in the long run we gain more than we lose, especially forcing the opponents to play higher from start.

---

### 1♧ / 1♢ / 1♡ / 1♤ -

- technically 4+ cards, 12+ HCP,
- third hand is 8+ HCP with escape to NT showing 4 cards but more points (12+)
  - With two 4-card suits, **open the lower one first**.
  - With a balanced 15-17 HCP hand, open 4 cards and **rebid notrump**.

#### Continuations

Responder may bid a **3-card suit** fit at the 2-level without fear - if opener had only 4 cards, he simply rebids 2NT. So a 2NT rebid confirms 4 cards (not 5) in the opening suit.

**Example**: 1H - 2H (with 3 cards, is pretty standard)

> **Matchpoints:** Be cautious with 2-of-a-minor fits - sometimes 1NT scores better.

- Raises to **2NT** and **3-level** fits are **invitational**.

#### 1-Minor Opening, 1-Major Response

> **Key rule:** After 1♧ or 1♢, a response of 1♡ or 1♤ promises **5 cards** if weak.
> With invitational+ strength, it may show only 4 cards (with a plan to rebid NT or raise).
> Therefore, **opener may support with just 3 cards!**

#### 1NT Response (Special Case)

A 1NT response typically shows:

- No fit for opener (at most 3 cards)
- **6-9 HCP**
- No 5-card major to bid, and no game ambitions

We may miss a 4-4 fit, but if we are weak, the opponents will bid again. If not, everyone has misfit or balanced hands - and NT is the right spot. Yes even with 4-4 major fit. But nobody scares to miss 4-4 fit when they open 15-17. NT and all pass.

#### Quick Reference

| Sequence  | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1♧ - 1♢   | Natural, 4+ diamonds, waiting            |
| 1♧ - 1♡/♤ | 5+ if weak; 4+ if strong (invitational+) |

---

### 2♧ - Semi-Strong (Benji)

Two main hand types:

#### Type 1 - Balanced

**22-23 HCP:** 2♧ - 2♢ - 2NT

#### Type 2 - Strong Major (Acol-style)

2♧ - 2♢ - 2♡/♤

- About 5 losers
- At least 5 cards in the suit (usually 6+)
- At least 3 top honours (A, K, Q)
- Partner needs roughly 2 "fillers" to make game

#### Type 3

_Future expansion: possibly two-suited hands or 4441 shapes - to be decided._

#### Responses to 2♧

| Response | Meaning                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2♢       | Waiting (0-7 HCP)                                           |
| 2♡       | Balanced, no 5-card suit                                    |
| 2♤       | 5+ spades                                                   |
| 2NT      | 5+ hearts **(!!)**                                          |
| 3♧ / 3♢  | 5+ clubs/diamonds, game-force, slam interest opposite 22-23 |

All non-2♢ responses are effectively **game-forcing (8+ HCP)**. This avoids the problem where, after 2♧ - 2♢ - 2♡, responder cannot show a 5-card major.

Opener accepts a fit immediately or continues describing his hand.

---

### 2♢ - Strong Game-Force

Responder shows **controls** (Ace = 2, King = 1):

| Response | Controls  |
| -------- | --------- |
| 2♡       | 0-1       |
| 2♤       | 2         |
| 2NT      | 3         |
| 3♧       | 4         |
| ...      | and so on |

Excellent for slam exploration.

---

### 2♡ / 2♤ - Weak Two

Disciplined, especially when vulnerable. Always consider that partner may hold 18+ HCP - so your weak two should show **reasonable values and suit quality**.

---

### 2NT - 20-21 HCP

With **Puppet Stayman**.

---

### 3-level and Above

| Opening | Meaning                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 3x      | **Preemptive** (destructive block)                 |
| 3NT     | **Gambling** - AKQxxxx in a minor, nothing outside |
| 4x      | _To be continued_                                  |
| 5x      | _Science fiction_                                  |

## Competitive Bidding

Generally standard methods apply. There are many conventions. But.. hold on.

### RAPTOR Convention

An overcall of **1NT** shows:

- **4 cards** in the unbid major
- **5 cards** in a minor

We bid using the **minimax principle** (aiming to sign off, tolerate a suit). This comes up more frequently than a natural 1NT (15-17) overcall.
If an opponent open 1 Major - we have 4 in unbid major and 5 in one of Minor.
If an opponent opens 1 Minor - we show 5 cards in another Minor and 4 card in unknown Major

## Defensive Carding

> **Use your head first, not partner's signals.**
> In most situations, the bidding and the dummy tell you everything you need to know.
> Signals are a **last resort**.

Some players become obsessed with carding, stop thinking for themselves, and put all their hopes on partner's signals - that is a mistake.

**Use signals only at critical moments** - typically at the start of play, or when declarer runs a long suit and you must decide which suits to protect. Or an opponent runs a long suit and you have to know even/odd in order to block it.

### 1. Attitude (Encourage / Discourage)

| Signal        | Meaning                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Low** card  | Encouraging - continue this suit |
| **High** card | Discouraging - please switch     |

**Exception:** When partner leads the **Ace**, give **count** (even/odd) instead of attitude.
Reason: if partner wants a continuation from AK, he leads the King. If he leads A without K, usually he doesn't even see what you signal and continues :). However, there is an unexpected dummy at the table and it requires a correction.

### 2. Count (Even / Odd)

| Signal        | Meaning              |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| **High** card | Even number of cards |
| **Low** card  | Odd number of cards  |

Easy to remember: from a **doubleton** (even), you play **high**.

### 3. Suit Preference on Discards (Italian Style)

When discarding from a suit you don't need:

| Discard                   | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Odd** card (3, 5, 7, 9) | Interest **in the suit being discarded**     |
| **Low even** card (2, 4)  | Interest in the **lower-ranking** side suit  |
| **High even** card (6, 8) | Interest in the **higher-ranking** side suit |

#### Signalling by Elimination

Sometimes you can't signal directly, so you deny:

| Sequence | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 4 then 2 | Denies interest in the lower suit     |
| 9 then 3 | Denies interest in the discarded suit |
| 8 then 6 | Denies interest in the higher suit    |

> **Rule of thumb:** The higher the discard, the less reliable the signal. The **second discard** confirms.

### 4. Opening Leads (Auspiel)

**Lead 3rd or 5th highest:**

| Holding   | Lead  | Rule        |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| K 9 5     | **5** | 3rd highest |
| K Q 7 5 2 | **2** | 5th highest |

#### Standard Lead Conventions

| Holding | Lead                    |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| xx      | Higher card             |
| xxx     | Middle, then high (MUD) |
| xxxx    | Highest safe, then low  |

> **Special rule:** If you hold the **Jack**, lead **4th highest**.
> Example: from K J 7 3 2, lead the **3** (not the 2).
