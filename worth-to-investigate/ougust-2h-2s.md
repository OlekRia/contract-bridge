# Ogust Convention (2NT Ask Over Weak Twos)

> Investigating: which Ogust variant fits our disciplined weak twos
> best, and whether Ogust is even the right choice vs a feature ask.

---

## Background

Created by **Harold A. Ogust** (1917-1978), American bridge player
from New York. Also known as the "Blue Club response" after Benito
Garozzo adopted it for the Italian Blue Team system in the 1960s.

The idea: after partner opens a weak two (2H/2S), responder bids
**2NT** to ask opener to classify his hand on two axes — **strength**
(minimum vs maximum) and **suit quality** (poor vs good).

---

## Standard Ogust

After 2H/2S - **2NT** (enquiry):

| Rebid | Strength | Suit Quality | Memory Aid |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 3C    | Minimum  | Poor suit    | bad-bad    |
| 3D    | Minimum  | Good suit    | bad-good   |
| 3H    | Maximum  | Poor suit    | good-bad   |
| 3S    | Maximum  | Good suit    | good-good  |
| 3NT   | Maximum  | Solid (AKQ)  | best       |

**Memory trick:** "Minors are Minimum" — 3C and 3D both show minimum
hands. The suit quality alternates: poor-good-poor-good-solid (or
think "1-2-1-2-3" top honours).

### Definitions (partnership-dependent)

| Term        | Typical Meaning                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Minimum     | 6-7 HCP (bottom of weak-two range)        |
| Maximum     | 8-10 HCP (top of weak-two range)          |
| Poor suit   | 0-1 of the top 3 honours (A, K, Q)        |
| Good suit   | 2+ of the top 3 honours                   |
| Solid suit  | AKQxxx — all three top honours            |

### Continuations After Opener's Rebid

| Responder's Action     | Meaning                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 3 of opener's major    | Sign-off (heard enough, stopping) |
| New suit at 3-level    | Forcing, 6+ cards, own suit       |
| 3NT                    | To play                           |
| 4 of opener's major    | To play                           |
| New suit at 4-level    | Cue-bid, slam exploration         |

## Reverse Ogust (The Original!)

What most people call "standard" Ogust is actually the later
modification. Ogust's **original** formulation swaps 3D and 3H:

| Rebid | Meaning                   |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 3C    | Minimum, poor suit (same) |
| 3D    | **Maximum, poor suit**    |
| 3H    | **Minimum, good suit**    |
| 3S    | Maximum, good suit (same) |
| 3NT   | Solid suit (same)         |

**Rationale:** when opener shows maximum via 3D (lower bid), there
is more room left for slam exploration. The maximum response — the
one that matters most — comes cheapest.

**Why most players switched away:** the non-reverse version (minors
= minimum) is simply easier to remember. The memory advantage won
over the theoretical bidding-space advantage.

---

## 3-Point Ogust (Simplified)

Collapses the two-axis system into a single holistic judgment:

| Rebid | Meaning                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 3C    | Worse than you would expect for my bid     |
| 3D    | About what you would expect                |
| 3H    | Better than you would expect               |

**Good for:** newer partnerships, casual play.
**Bad for:** precision — "better/worse than expected" is very
subjective and depends on vulnerability, position, style.

## Meckstroth Ogust (For 5-Card Weak Twos)

When the partnership allows weak twos on **5-card suits**, knowing
the suit length becomes critical. Jeff Meckstroth's approach:

| Rebid | Meaning                                      |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 3C    | 5-card suit (3D relay asks about quality)    |
| 3D    | 6-card suit, poor hand                       |
| 3H    | 6-card suit, average hand                    |
| 3S    | 6-card suit, good hand                       |
| 3NT   | AKQ-topped suit                              |

**Not relevant for us** — we always promise 6 cards for a weak two.
But worth knowing in case we ever relax that requirement.

---

## Modified Ogust (Stopper-Focused)

Restructures responses around what matters for 3NT decisions —
side-suit stoppers rather than abstract min/max:

After 2S - 2NT:

| Rebid | Meaning                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 3C    | Has an outside stopper (3D asks where)        |
| 3D    | Unusual hand — extra outside values           |
| 3H    | Pure preempt, maximum for the vulnerability   |
| 3S    | Pure preempt, minimum for the vulnerability   |
| 3NT   | AKQxxx in trumps                              |

After 3C, responder bids 3D to ask which stopper:

- 3H = hearts, 3S = diamonds, 3NT = clubs.

**Advantage:** directly answers "can we play 3NT?"
**Disadvantage:** complex, reveals stopper location to opponents.

---

## The Main Alternative: Feature Ask

Many partnerships (the ACBL default) use 2NT to ask for a
**feature** (outside Ace or King) instead of Ogust:

| Rebid                | Meaning                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Rebid the weak suit  | Minimum, nothing to show          |
| New suit             | Non-min, outside A or K in suit   |
| 3NT                  | Non-min, solid or near-solid suit |

**Advantage:** directly locates side-suit values for 3NT.
**Disadvantage:** tells opponents exactly where your honour sits.

## Ogust vs Feature Ask — When to Use Which

| Factor                      | Favours Ogust             | Favours Feature Ask        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Weak two discipline         | Wide-range, aggressive    | Tight, disciplined         |
| Key question                | "How good IS your preempt?" | "WHERE are your values?"  |
| Info leaked to opponents    | Min/max + suit quality    | Exact location of honour   |
| 3NT decisions               | Weaker                    | Stronger                   |
| Suit-game decisions         | Stronger                  | Weaker                     |
| Ease of use                 | Moderate                  | Simple                     |

**Expert opinions:**
- Larry Cohen: prefers Feature Ask — the main question is "do you
  like your hand?" plus "where is your outside value?"
- Terence Reese: Feature Ask, as simpler and more practical.
- Richard Pavlicek: with truly sound weak twos, abandon both and
  make all responses constructive and natural.
- Consensus: if your weak twos are disciplined (always 6 cards,
  6-10 HCP, good suit quality), Feature Ask is often better
  because you already know the suit is good — you need to know
  WHERE the outside values are.

## Handling Interference

When opponents act over the 2NT enquiry:

### After a Double of 2NT

Use **DOPI** or **ROPI**:

| Method | Meaning                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| DOPI   | Double = 1st step (3C), Pass = 2nd step    |
| ROPI   | Redouble = 1st step, Pass = 2nd step       |

### After an Overcall Over 2NT

Preferred: **P0D1** (Pass = first step, Double = second step,
cheapest bid = third step).

Why P0D1 over D0P1: with a bad hand and bad suit (first step),
opener may want to let the opponents play their contract rather
than doubling them.

## Calibration by Vulnerability

What counts as "minimum" vs "maximum" shifts:

| Vulnerability | Minimum Range | Maximum Range | Suit Standard |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Unfavourable  | 8-9 HCP       | 10-11 HCP     | Strict        |
| Both vul      | 7-8 HCP       | 9-10 HCP      | Strict        |
| None vul      | 6-7 HCP       | 8-10 HCP      | Moderate      |
| Favourable    | 5-7 HCP       | 8-10 HCP      | Relaxed       |

Our system plays **disciplined** weak twos at all vulnerabilities,
so the min/max split is roughly 6-7 vs 8-10 regardless.

---

## Recommendation for All Fives

Our weak twos are **disciplined**: always 6 cards, reasonable
values, decent suit quality. This means:

1. **Standard Ogust fits well.** The min/max + suit quality axes
   match our discipline. Partner opens 2H, we bid 2NT, and the
   response directly tells us whether game is on.

2. **Feature Ask would also work** — since our suits are always
   decent, the main remaining question is often "where are your
   outside values?" for 3NT decisions.

3. **Reverse Ogust** has a theoretical advantage (more room after
   maximum) but the memory cost is not worth it.

4. **Modified/Meckstroth** are over-engineered for our needs.

### What we wrote in some-extensions.md

| Opener's Rebid | Meaning                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 3C             | Minimum (6-7), poor suit (one honour)   |
| 3D             | Minimum (6-7), good suit (two+ honours) |
| 3H             | Maximum (8-10), poor suit               |
| 3S             | Maximum (8-10), good suit               |

This is **standard Ogust**, and it is the right choice for us.
Simple, well-known, matches our disciplined style.

**Open question:** should we add 3NT = solid suit (AKQxxx)?
Probably yes — it costs nothing and helps responder count tricks
for slam.

**Open question:** should we define DOPI/P0D1 for interference?
Worth discussing — it comes up rarely but when it does, having an
agreement prevents a disaster.
