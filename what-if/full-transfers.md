# What If: Full Transfers?

> **Proposal:** Extend transfer bidding beyond 1NT/2NT — to suit opening responses or even transfer openings.
>
> **Verdict: Rejected.** Transfers already exist where they belong (1NT and 2NT). Extending further contradicts the system's philosophy.

## What we already have

- **1NT responses:** 2♢ = hearts, 2♡ = spades, 2♤ = clubs, 3♧ = diamonds.
- **2NT responses:** Puppet Stayman with transfers.
- **2♧ response:** 2NT = 5+ hearts (!!) — transfer-like.

Transfers are already in place everywhere the concealed-hand argument applies (NT openings).

## Transfer responses to 1-minor openings

After 1♧: 1♢ = transfer to hearts, 1♡ = transfer to spades.

**Problems:**

1. **Loses the natural diamond response.** 1♢ now means hearts. How does responder show diamonds? You'd need 1NT = diamonds, destroying its current meaning (6-9, no fit, no ambition).

2. **Marginal gain at the 1-level.** Concealment matters most over NT where the opening lead goes into the hidden hand. After a suit opening, opener's hand is already partially described.

3. **Competitive disaster.** After 1♧ - (1♤) - ?, transfers break entirely. Over 1NT opponents compete less often. Over suit openings, they compete on almost every hand.

4. **Kills "5 if weak."** Currently 1♧ - 1♡ means "I have 5+ hearts if weak." Simple, natural. With transfers, bids look like one thing and mean another — directly contradicts "bids mean what they look like."

## Transfer openings

Opening 1♢ to show hearts, 1♡ to show spades (Polish Club style). This isn't a modification of All Fives — it's a different system entirely. Also likely restricted at EBU tournament levels.

## Summary

| Level              | Transfers?   | Status          |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Over 1NT           | Yes          | Already there   |
| Over 2NT           | Yes          | Already there   |
| Over suit openings | No           | Breaks the system |
| Transfer openings  | No           | Different system  |

The system already has transfers everywhere they make sense. No further extension is beneficial.
