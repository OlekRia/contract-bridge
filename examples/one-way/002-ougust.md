# Hand 3 — North deals, E-W vulnerable

North (you, dealer): ♠ KQJ975  ♡ 83  ♢ J74  ♧ 62
South (partner):     ♠ A3 ♡ AK75 ♢ KQ82 ♧ J94

(E-W: East ♠86 ♡QJ106 ♢A105 ♧AQ73 | West ♠1042 ♡942 ♢963 ♧K1085)

North: 7 HCP, 6 spades, KQJ975 — nice suit.

❯ 2s

⏺ 2♤ — textbook weak two. 7 HCP, 6-card suit headed by KQJ. Exactly what the bid is designed for.

South's turn. 17 HCP, ♠A3 (fitting partner's suit), ♡AK75, ♢KQ82.
Combined: at least 23 HCP with an 8-card spade fit. Game is clear.

But here's the problem — South might wonder about slam. If North has
a maximum (9-10) with that good suit, slam could be there. Without
Ogust, South has no way to ask. 2NT isn't defined as an enquiry in
the current system.

So South does the practical thing:

South bids: 4♤
┌───────┬──────┬───────┬──────┐

└───────┴──────┴───────┴──────┘
Final contract: 4♤ by North

North (declarer): ♠ K Q J 9 7 5 ♡ 8 3 ♢ J 7 4 ♧ 6 2
South (dummy): ♠ A 3 ♡ A K 7 5 ♢ K Q 8 2 ♧ J 9 4

Trick count: ♠AKQJ = 4 top spade tricks + 5th and 6th spades are
winners after drawing trumps = 6 spade tricks. ♡AK = 2. ♢KQ = 1
(♢A is with East). That's already 9 tricks, and a diamond ruff or
favourable lie gets the 10th. 4♤ makes comfortably.

System verdict: The weak two worked — it described the hand in one
bid and South could value the combined assets easily. But this hand
shows exactly why Ogust (extension #1 on your list) earns its place.
With Ogust:

- South bids 2NT (enquiry)
- North responds 3♢ (minimum 6-7, good suit — two+ honours)
- South now knows: minimum points but solid suit. 4♤ is right, slam is not.

  Without Ogust, South had to guess. Here the guess was easy (17 HCP
  = bid game), but with 14-15 HCP it would be a pure coin flip.
