  South opens 1NT (12–14). Your bid?

❯ 2♦

⏺ 2♦ — transfer to hearts. After 1NT, the transfer structure is:
  2♣ = Puppet Stayman, 2♦ = transfer to ♥, 2♥ = transfer to ♠,
  2♠ = transfer to ♣, 3♣ = transfer to ♦.

  South completes: 2♥.

  What now?

❯ Pass

⏺ Pass — correct! In a 12–14 NT system, the invite/game thresholds are
  higher than in 15–17:

  With 12–14 NT:
  - 0–9 HCP + 6-card major: transfer and pass (sign off)
  - 10–11 HCP: transfer then 3M (invite)
  - 12+ HCP: transfer then 4M (game)

  With 9 HCP, even opposite a maximum 14, combined is only 23 — typically
  short for 4♥. And this hand has structural problems: ♠83 and ♣1074 are
  dead weight, communication between the hands is poor.

  Final contract: 2♥ by South

  North (dummy):    ♠ 8 3        ♥ A Q 9 7 6 2   ♦ K 5     ♣ 10 7 4
  South (declarer): ♠ A 10 5     ♥ K J 4          ♦ Q 9 7 3  ♣ K 8 6

  Trick count: Hearts split 2-2, draw trumps in 2 rounds, cash remaining
  hearts = 6–7 heart tricks. ♠A = 1. ♦K or ♦Q = 1. That's 8–9 tricks.
  2♥ makes comfortably, likely +1 or +2 for +140 or +170.

  4♥ would need 10 tricks — unlikely with only 22 combined HCP, dead
  black-suit holdings, and ♦A offside. Going down in 4♥ vulnerable = -100
  instead of collecting a safe +140.

  System verdict: The transfer did its job — placed the contract in the
  right strain at the right level. Recognising that 9 HCP is a sign-off
  opposite 12–14 NT (not an invite) is a key calibration point for this
  system. The invite threshold shifts upward when NT range is weaker.
