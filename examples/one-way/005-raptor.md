  You know South has exactly 4 spades. You have ♠K763 — that's an 8-card spade fit guaranteed. Your bid?

⏺ 2♤ — perfect. You know the 4-4 spade fit exists, 8 HCP is enough to compete but not invite.

  Everyone passes:

  Final contract: 2♤ by North

  North (declarer):  ♠ K 7 6 3    ♡ 10 8 4    ♢ A 7 2    ♧ J 9 5
  South (dummy):     ♠ A Q 10 4   ♡ 7 2       ♢ K J 8 6 5 ♧ Q 3

  Trick count: 20 combined HCP, 4-4 spade fit, 5-3 diamond fit. 4 spade tricks after drawing trumps (3-2 split), 4 diamond
  tricks (lose ♢Q to East), lose ♡AK to East, lose ♧A to West. 2♤ making, +110.

  Meanwhile E-W can make 2♡ their way (13+7 = 20 HCP, 5-3 heart fit). So this is a competitive partscore deal where both sides
  can make 2 of their suit.

  System verdict: RAPTOR did exactly its job. South's 1NT instantly told you: "I have 4 spades and a minor." You had 4 spades —
  bid 2♤, fit found, contract reached in two bids. Without RAPTOR, South would have to overcall 2♢ (natural), and the spade fit
  might never be found. You'd end up defending 2♡ instead of competing.
