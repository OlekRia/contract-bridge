  North opens 1♣. You have 8 HCP and 4 spades. Your response?

❯ 2♠

⏺ Discussion: 2♠ is a weak, non-forcing option that shows spades and
  invites partner to pass if minimum. In All Fives, suit responses require
  5+ cards, so 1♠ with only 4 spades is debatable. 2♠ works tactically as
  a weak signal, but 1♠ keeps the auction more flexible with 8 HCP opposite
  an opening bid (22+ combined).

  System note: All Fives requires 5-card suits for weak responses. With
  only 4 spades and 8 HCP, both 1♠ and 2♠ have merit depending on
  partnership agreement.
