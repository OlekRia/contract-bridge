  North opens 1NT. You have 11 HCP and both majors. Your bid?

❯ 2♣

⏺ 2♣ — Correct! Puppet Stayman. You have two majors (4 spades, 5 hearts) in
  the invite range (11 HCP). Puppet asks opener for a 5-card major before
  committing to a specific strain. If opener has 5 spades, great — you've
  found a fit. If not, you can bid 3♥ to show your hearts and invite game.

  North responds: 2♦ (no 5-card major).

  Final contract: 4♥ by North

  North (declarer):  ♠ K 9 4       ♥ J 7 3      ♦ K J 6    ♣ A K 8 5
  South (dummy):     ♠ Q J 8 7     ♥ K 10 9 8 5 ♦ 3        ♣ Q 7 2

  Trick count: ♥KJT9 draws trumps (2-2 split), 3 heart tricks. ♠K + ♠A = 2.
  ♣AKQ = 3. Total = 8 tricks minimum. With the ♠Q and added club values,
  4♥ makes comfortably, +620.

  System verdict: Puppet Stayman from responder's view. You asked for a
  5-card major. Opener denied one, so you showed your hearts at the invite
  level (3♥). North with a maximum and good cards raised to game. This
  auction—2♣ → 2♦ → 3♥ → 4♥—is the standard responder pattern when Puppet
  finds no major fit. Without Puppet, you'd transfer to hearts and never
  explore the spade possibility.
