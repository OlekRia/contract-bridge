South bids: 1♤

Natural, 5 spades (per the system — 5+ by default at the 1-level),
6+ HCP. South has 11 HCP with ♠K7543 ♡A64 ♢A3 ♧854, easily enough
for a 1-level response.

Your rebid as North?

❯ 2S

⏺ 2♤ — simple raise, showing 3-card spade support (AQ7 is excellent).
A conservative choice with 15 HCP; some would rebid 1NT (15-17
balanced) to show the extra strength, but 2♤ gets the fit across
immediately.

South's turn. South has 11 HCP, 5 spades, a known fit, and ♢A3
sitting behind partner's diamond opening. Combined values: at least
23 HCP with an 8-card spade fit. That's game territory.

South bids: 4♤

No need to mess around. 11 HCP opposite an opener who raised = game.

Final contract: 4♤ by South

Let's check the result:
North: ♠ A Q 7 South: ♠ K 7 5 4 3
♡ K 8 2 ♡ A 6 4
♢ K J 9 7 5 ♢ A 3
♧ Q 6 ♧ 8 5 4

Combined: 26 HCP, 8 spades (5-3), 7 diamonds (5-2).

Trick count: Lose ♠ (if 3-2 split, lose 0-1 spade), likely lose 1-2
clubs, maybe 1 heart. With 5 diamond tricks, 4-5 spade tricks, ♡A,
♡K — that's 10-11 tricks comfortably. 4♤ makes, likely +1.

System verdict: The auction worked well. 1♢ showed the 5-card suit,
1♤ found the major, 2♤ confirmed the fit. South correctly valued the
hand for game. Clean and efficient.

    >> P.S. I am not agreed: better 1S - 2S - 3S - 4S
