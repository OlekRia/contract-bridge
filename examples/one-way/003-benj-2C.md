  Your rebid to show the strong spade hand?

  Game is certain, slam is unlikely with a flat hand.

  South bids: 4♤

  Final contract: 4♤ by North

  North (declarer):  ♠ A K J 10 8 5  ♡ A Q 3   ♢ K J     ♧ 7 2
  South (dummy):     ♠ Q 7 3         ♡ K 8 5    ♢ A 8 7 4  ♧ 9 6 3

  Trick count: ♠AKQJ = draw trumps in 2-3 rounds (2-2 split), 6 spade tricks. ♡AKQ (finesse not even needed — K in dummy) = 3
  hearts. ♢AK = 2 diamonds. That's 11 tricks — 4♤ making +1.

  Lose just ♧A and ♧Q to East. Comfortable make.

  System verdict: The Benji 2♧ worked cleanly. 2♧ → 2♢ relay → 2♤ showed the hand type in three bids. South with fitting cards
  and 9 HCP had an easy raise to game. The auction was efficient — no guesswork, no ambiguity.
